# DiscordBot

A easy and basic discord bot. (New Commands coming soon!)

# Install instructions: 

First, make sure you have node.js, npm, and git installed.

Next, run git clone https://github.com/EthanDevelops/DiscordBot.git

Then run npm install or nmp install discord.js

Then, edit the config.json file with your favorite text editor, and edit the token value like this: 
(make sure to get rid of |YOUR BOT TOKEN HERE| and replace it with your bot token.):

"token": "|YOUR BOT TOKEN HERE|"

You can get a bot token at https://discord.com/developers/applications and creating a new application, and creating a bot token for it.

Add your bot to a server using OAuth2 (see discord docs: https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2#bots) 

Finally, you can run node index.js and your bot will work!
